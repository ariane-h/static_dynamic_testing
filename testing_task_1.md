### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame

  #card game isn't initialized, it also doesn't have any readers or writers

  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  dif highest_card(card1 card2) #dif should be def, there should be a comma between card1 and card2
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card #card should be replaced with card1
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end #remove extra end

def self.cards_total(cards)
  total #total should be defined and assigned to a value
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total #move this line outside of the for loop beneath line 33. Interpolate total
  end
end

#class is missing an end
```
